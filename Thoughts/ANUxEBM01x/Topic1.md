While I'm not really interested in a management role at the moment, I found it interesting to know how people are managing and controlling their staff and enterprise, I decided to take a look at this course to find more measurables and scientific way to monitore performance.

As a software developer I've heard about companies measuring performance into different ways, some of then are below:
-Number of written code: I find it to be pretty dumb, and future error prone, why would more words mean better? The developer may end up hurrying up the code instead of doing better research for better algorithms and performance.
-Number of commits: Same as above
-Number of accept commits: This is more interesting, althought I think that "harder" commits should get some kind of bonus
-Hours in front of the computer: Yeah, not kidding, there was a company that required the developer to have a webcam so they could monitor when he was in front of the computer, looking at the screen with the IDE open, doing his work...

What those methods fail to measure is how much impact that developer had in the application, while having a negative impact for fast work, fast ain't bad and also good ain't equal to slow, but I wonder about the issues that a bad written function could had in the future, just because the guy needed to ship something. Someone may have changed 5 css colors elements after studying on it for 3 weeks, so it was a horrible "coding" performance, but the click counter on those changed items grown more than 5 times...

If we consider modern frameworks like Scrum we could have the scrum master monitoring the developer, and doing an analyses for each sprint, grading the importance of the developer work had on each sprint, while still mainting a group performance due to the sprints planning, it's better than most of the above, but some could also say it's not scientific.

In the first lesson, we are recommended a read of this article from Harvard Business Review, about Deloitte and their quest to measure employee performance, it's also interesting to see that they are now also doing short term reviews (weekly) of their teams, besides the annual one.

In this first lesson we are also introduced to the 6As of Evidence Based Management, they are bellow with my super resume about them:

Ask: Understand the problem
Acquire: Get evidence/data related to the problem
Aprraise: Is the acquired data valid?
Aggregate: If the aprraise is true, aggregate and organize all the data for later use
Apply: Use the aggregate data to resolve the problem
Assess: Has the problem been solved? How do you? Caused any non predictable issue?
