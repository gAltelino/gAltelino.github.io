In this lecture the professor starts with the classic search tree problem, which is sometimes great, when our data to be analysed is small or when we don't expect to reach the last right node to find our best solution, but anyways it will get messy with more items and more itens, basically the search tree do every possible combination of the items avaliable. Our algorith complexity is 2^n, n is the number of itens, so let's say we have 15 itens, we would have 32768 combinations, a lot, but should be pretty easy for most computers, but if we just double to 30 itens we would have 1073741824, soon each code run will become impractible for real world use.

After that we are introduced to the fibonacci algorithm, a classic, you should look for it, and an quite interesting way to make it faster, way faster, dynamic programming, a Fibonacci function takes a number, and recursively subtract -1 and -2 for every n, the final result is the sum of all those recursions.
The issue is you end up calculating the result of the same n many times, so the idea of the dynamic programming is to avoid those already made calculations, by introducting a map, array, vector, etc etc, to store values of already made calculations, so each time, instead of calculating Fibonacci of N, the program check if that N was already calculated and just get the value of it, which was stored in the array, and if it was the first calculation, it do the math, and then saves the value of N in the array to used later. I find it quite interesting, and also I'm not sure I've read about it.
Dynamic programming could be used in any case where there is a repetition of a calculation, usually with repeated combinations, and also if the algorithm is compatible with it. Besied the one from the course, I'll show a quick example below in C#.

Imagine a chiq online clothes store, who has 10 thousand registered customers, let's imagine a really bad designed database, where we can't find how much each customer has bought, because the sales tables has no registration of the client ID only the client doctument because of the taxes, and the client table, and this store decided to hire a famous artist to go to their top customer house, as a surprise... digest
